Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?

Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?

Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?

How would you describe the experience of using this app?

Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?

Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?
